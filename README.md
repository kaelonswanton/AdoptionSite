Practiced Responsive Design using Mobile view and Laptop L view via inspect element. Had the biggest trouble balancing images and making sure their size would fit on large screens without messing up the layout. Using relative/absolute is still very difficult. I should have added in variables for certain margin/padding sizes, but still find it difficult to plan that far ahead.
